# odds_and_evens
Game assignment for Udemy Bootcamp (adapted from Dicee game)

This is an assigment from Udemy's "The complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp", Section 12. Originally it would be a simple dice game. 2 dices were shown, assigned to two players and after hitting the button 'play' the dice would randomly show a number. The greater number wins.

I decided to develop a 'evens or odds'game instead. There's no similar game in the App Store, which opens the possibility to adapt this game for Swift and deploy it there. Moreover, since there's no possible tie, it's even more efficient to resolve disputes!
